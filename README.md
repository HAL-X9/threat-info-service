# Threat Info Service

A REST service in Go for storing and exchanging threat intelligence, with each threat identified by the MD5 hash of the malicious file.

The API is spec-first: the OpenAPI document is the single source of truth for the contract. Server stubs are generated from it, and requests are validated against the same schema they are documented with, so the specification and the implementation cannot drift apart.
